# Bulleter

Just a simple ReasonML program that allows me to format note dumps using an idea I started using based on general bullet jounaling principles, except not really.

## Why?

I have been wanting to write something like this before, and it seemed simple enough for my first ReasonML project.

## How to run it

```shell
$ node path/to/Bulleter.bs.js path/to/inNotes.md path/to/outNotes.md 
```
